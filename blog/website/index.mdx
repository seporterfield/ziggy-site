Making this website has been fun. I had bought the domain name a while ago and thought I should do something with it.
Not a bad idea when applying to jobs, either.

I spent a weekend doing the Gatsby intro tutorials.
My buddy Suraj taught me some more React concepts along with some Tailwind basics.

Hopefully, there will be more of this soon.
