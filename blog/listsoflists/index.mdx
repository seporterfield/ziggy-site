A friend of mine and I have been adding some fun features to the discord server we use together with our friends, and we wanted to pimp it out.
He sent me a massive list of [self-hosted software on Github](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) and we spent an hour going through it and picking the best things out for the server.

A week later, we found ourselves going through another list, [awesome hilarious repos.](https://github.com/terremoth/awesome-hilarious-repos "https://github.com/terremoth/awesome-hilarious-repos")
This sent me down the rabbit hole of looking for even more lists to go through, until I found this: [List of Lists of Github Lists](https://github.com/yaph/lologl)

Take a look for yourself. It's a great way to kill time and discover what kind of notable software really is out there.
